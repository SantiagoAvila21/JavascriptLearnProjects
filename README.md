# JavascriptLearnProjects
This is a learning repository where i push all the self-projects am doing to learn Javascript.

It started with simplier projects like a counter, a color flipper and others, then I started to raise the difficulty, doing things like a CRUD of some grocery list, working with a weather API, creating a "Binary Search Visualization" that shows the process of a binary search step by step.

Once I'm done with this "Vanilla" Javascript Learning repository, I'm gonna start to learn React Js, Css preprocessors, and others to improve my skills as a self-taught in road to Full-Stack Developer
